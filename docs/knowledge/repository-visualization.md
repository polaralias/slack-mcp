# slack-mcp repository OKF visualization

## Source and scope

The repository root is the visualization bundle. Skill-package trees and the generated Mermaid report are excluded by [the persisted view policy](../../.okf-visualization-ignore).

## Outputs

- [Interactive HTML workspace](../visualizations/repository-okf.html)
- [Scalable Mermaid report](../visualizations/repository-okf.mermaid.md)

## Interpretation

The generated Graph, Board, and Reader views are derived navigation aids. Repository Markdown and YAML records remain authoritative.

## Verification

Regenerate both outputs with the repository-task visualizer and run its freshness check after meaningful record or renderer changes.
